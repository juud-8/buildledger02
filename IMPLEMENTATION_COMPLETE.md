```

3. **`src/components/ui/ConfirmationModal.tsx`** - Reusable confirmation modal

### **Modified Files**
1. **`src/app/invoices/new/page.tsx`** - Now redirects to preview
2. **`src/app/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx`** - Now redirects to preview
3. **`BUTTON_NAVIGATION_AUDIT_REPORT.md`** - Updated with resolution status

4. User sees preview with "NEW INVOICE" badge
5. User can Edit, Cancel (with confirmation), or Confirm
6. Confirm ‚Üí Goes to final invoice view

### **Edit Invoice Flow**
1. User edits invoice and clicks "Update Invoice"
2. **NEW**: Redirects to `/invoices/preview/{id}?mode=edit`
3. User sees preview with "EDITED" badge

5. Confirm ‚Üí Goes to final invoice view

## üéâ **Result**
